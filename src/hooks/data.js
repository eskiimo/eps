    desc: "Some electrical appliances and old wiring may have a normal small amount of earth leakage which can trip a RCD. Earth leakage increases with each additional electrical appliance that is plugged in, and if RCD keeps tripping out it may be an overloaded circuit. Any faults we recommend that you have your wiring and appliances checked by an electrician to ascertain the fault if a RCD keeps tripping. The majority of electrical fatalities could have been prevented by the use of a properly installed RCD, and regular testing to ensure they are working correctly",

Power Factor Correction unit have various functioning settings depending upon on the position they are installed. Moisture, time, harmonics and temperature changes the power factor correction of capacitor banks. Already installed capacitor banks, if not tested or unmaintained within specific time, becomes incapable of functioning at their finest levels. With time, the operation of capacitors can weaken, decreasing the power factor of your power system, resulting in power factor loss.",

Because of the severity of coming into contact with an electrical fault, having your electrical installations and power points tested for earth fault loop impedance is crucial. Your systems are valuable and circuitry needs to be maintained for the durability and functionality of your business.

The International Electrical Testing Association specifies ground electrode testing every three years for a system in good condition with average up-time requirements. Poor grounding not only increases the risk of equipment failure; it is dangerous too. Facilities need to have adequately grounded electrical systems so in the event of a lightning strike, or util ",
